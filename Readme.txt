This project originated as part of the graduate class "Computer Aided Geometrical Design" at UC Berkeley.
It allows to load models in the *.off file format, assign textures to them and then perform a subdivision algorithm.
For a short explanation on how to use the program, refer to "Final Report.pdf".

To build, perform C-Make to generate a solution, which can be build and run.
The required dependencies GLUT, GLEW, OPENGL and QT need to be installed on your machine in order to sucessfully build the project.
